# How to use gizzard

The source-code to Gizzard is on github: [http://github.com/twitter/gizzard](http://github.com/twitter/gizzard).

A sample application that uses Gizzard, called Rowz, is also available:
[http://github.com/nkallen/Rowz](http://github.com/nkallen/Rowz). The best way
to get started with Gizzard is to clone Rowz and customize.

## Building

We use [sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) to build:

    $ sbt clean update package-dist

but there are some pre-requisites. You need:

- java 1.6
- sbt 0.7.4
- thrift 0.2.0

Apache Thrift 0.2.0 is pre-requisite for building java stubs of the thrift
IDL. It can't be installed via jar, so you'll need to install it separately
before you build.

In addition, the tests require a local MySQL instance to be running, and for
`DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` environment variables to contain login info
for it.

The sbt build should download any missing jars using ivy (which is ant's
implementation of the maven dependency fetcher) and build a jar in `dist/`.

## Installation

### Maven

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.twitter</groupId>
        <artifactId>gizzard</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>

It may require you to add the "scala-tools" maven repo to your repo list. The
nest repo is located here:

    http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/

### Sbt

    val gizzard = "com.twitter" % "gizzard" % "1.5.0"

You will need to add a reference to the "scala-tools" repo if it isn't already
there:

    val scalaToolsReleases = "scala-tools.org" at "http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/"
